# PythonGameofLife
Simple Game of Life written in Python 3.7, using PyGame library to animate the cells. It features a random mode and a editor
mode.The former starts the simulation from a random set of living cells,the latter lets you edit before and during the 
simulation.In editor mode, press "s" to start the simulation,"p" to pause and edit and "q" to quit.
WARNING: The code is not at all commented and not optimized.Kinda "spaghetty"
